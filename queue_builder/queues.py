"""Curated-queue store: read + prune the hand-edited `queues.yaml` wishlist.

The six `source="queue"` sets (bob / bob_alice / family and their _anime
siblings) are NOT computed by rule — Bob writes an ordered list per set into
`queues.yaml` (top = next to play). The file lives in App-Configs, mounted RW at
`config.QUEUES_PATH`, and is re-read on every scan. A finished entry is KEPT and tagged
`done: true` (mark_done), never auto-pruned — anime has no "Season 2", so the finished
series stays visible as the anchor Bob adds the sequel next to (decision
2026-07-21-finished-entries-marked-done-not-pruned, superseding the auto-prune half of
2026-07-16-movie-queue-sets-yaml-wishlist.md). Removal is explicit only (`prune`, driven
by a Node endpoint / per-item delete).

Round-trip via ruamel.yaml so hand-written comments + ordering survive the prune. If
ruamel is unavailable (e.g. the read-only dry-run env without the image deps), we fall
back to PyYAML for READS; a prune-rewrite is skipped with a warning rather than
clobbering the file's formatting.

## Entry formats (decision 2026-07-20-queue-entries-are-title-strings.md)

An entry is any of:

  * a **human-readable title string** — the primary, hand-editable form:
      - `- Duel (1971)`                         title + year
      - `- 86 Eighty-Six (2021) [anidb-16172]`  title + year + a `[source-id]` guid hint
      - `- Cowboy Bebop`                         bare title
    resolved against the set's Plex section at scan time (see plex._resolve_title).
  * a bare **ratingKey** (`- 12345`) — precise; what the web UI / AI write.
  * a **mapping** carrying either/both (`- {ratingKey: 12345, title: "Megamind (2010)"}`)
    — a ratingKey with a human label. The `title:` value is itself parsed as a title
    string (so a mapping can also carry `(year)`/`[guid]` if it has no ratingKey).

A human never needs a ratingKey; titles resolve fresh each scan and their exact text is
never rewritten (an unresolved title is kept + flagged, not clobbered).
