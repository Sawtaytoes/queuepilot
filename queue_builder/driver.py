"""Playback state machine: sample the Shield's real state, then drive it to `playing`.

This replaces service._do_start's fire-and-forget tail (ensure_plex_open at the top ->
wait_for_profile -> best-effort `_adb_switch_async` -> join -> play) with a machine that
SAMPLES real state and runs VERIFIED, RETRIED, NON-DESTRUCTIVE transitions toward the target:

    unreachable ──▶ device_on ──▶ plex_foreground ──▶ signed_in(required) ──▶ playing(target)

Every edge verifies it landed before proceeding, retries a bounded number of times, and never
destroys progress it can't recover cheaply (no force-stop of a running movie, no picker walk
when already on the right profile). Play is ALWAYS the last action, and it is verified: the
Companion port is probed and Plex confirmed foreground immediately before playMedia fires.

Gated behind config.PLAYBACK_FSM (default off) so the legacy path in service stays live until
the owner verifies this on the real Shield. Reuses the existing adb / profiles / playback
primitives — it does not re-derive picker or profile logic. See
docs/playback-state-machine-design.md.
