/**
 * React's half of FLIP, for a list React itself renders.
 *
 * The vanilla `flipPaint()` measured, mutated, then measured again — all inside one
 * function. React splits those apart: the mutation is the commit. So the "First"
 * measurement happens in the RENDER phase, where the DOM still holds the previous
 * commit, and the "Last" measurement + animation happen in a layout effect.
 *
 * Measuring the DOM during render is impure, and it is also the only place the
 * pre-mutation boxes still exist. It is safe here specifically because the read has
 * no side effect on the tree: under StrictMode's double render it simply measures
 * the same unchanged DOM twice.
 *
 * `signature` is what identifies "the list changed" — pass a join of the keys plus
 * whatever else re-orders them. `animate` is false for a first paint of a newly
 * opened queue (the vanilla `gridPaintedSet === set` test), because opening a
 * different queue is not a shuffle of the current one.
