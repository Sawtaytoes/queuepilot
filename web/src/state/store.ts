 * This is deliberately not React context + a reducer. The vanilla app kept `DATA`,
 * `REG`, `NOW` and `selected` as module globals that *any* handler could read, and
 * a dozen of its correctness rules are stated in those terms — `uiBusy()` reads six
 * of them at once from an SSE callback that has no component to hang off. Modelling
 * them as module state and subscribing components to the whole snapshot keeps those
 * rules literally true, and matches the original's "repaint the whole view" model,
 * which is what `gridPaintedSet` / `membersPaintedCh` / the FLIP guards assume.
 *
 * Search input state deliberately stays local to its component, so typing does not
 * re-render the grid.

   * `/api/queues` has to talk to Plex — roughly sixty calls to resolve titles, next
   * episodes and collection children — and takes 2.6-2.8 s. Waiting for it left the
   * page blank and then inserted ten shelves at once, which is where the 0.398 CLS
   * came from and most of what "the app feels slow" meant.
   *
   * Phase 1 paints the COMPLETE page structure: `/api/shelves` (~15 ms, no Plex at
   * all) for the shelves and their tile count, and `/api/sets` for the registry.
   * Phase 2 swaps in resolved posters and next-episode lines. The second response
   * changes pixels, not layout.
   *
   * **The registry belongs in phase 1, not phase 2.** It is what the Play landing's
   * Dynamic group renders from, and `/api/sets` costs exactly one Plex call
   * (`/library/sections`) that already degrades to an empty library list when Plex is
   * down. Leaving it in phase 2 painted a landing page with an empty Dynamic group
   * for as long as `/api/queues` took, and those rows then popped in — reintroducing
   * the shift this phase exists to remove. `e2e/ui-test.mjs` catches it.
   *
   * Phase 1 is best-effort as a whole: if it throws, phase 2 still renders the page
   * exactly as it did before any of this existed.
