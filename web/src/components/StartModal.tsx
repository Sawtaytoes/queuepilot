 * "Start from…" — the manual start point for a show / collection entry.

 * Everything here is **PICKED, never typed**: the member series, the season, the
 * real episode title. A typed number can name an episode that doesn't exist, or the
 * wrong season; a list of real episode titles (with watched marks) can't.
 * (decisions `2026-07-31-start-episode-is-picked-in-a-modal` and
 * `2026-07-31-per-entry-start-episode-override`)
 *
 * The three rows appear per entry kind:
 *
 * | Entry                          | Rows                          |
 * | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
 * | Show, one season (every anime) | Episode                       |
 * | Show, several seasons          | Season, then Episode          |
 * | Collection                     | Series, then Season/Episode — or nothing more when the member is a movie |
 *
 * Already-watched episodes say so **in words**, because an `<option>` cannot be
 * styled and a ✓ glyph is a tofu box in some fonts.
