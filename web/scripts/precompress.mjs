// Build-time pre-compression of the Vite output.
//
// Why in-repo and not in the reverse proxy: openresty sits in front of this app but is NOT
// versioned with it, so a compression rule there is invisible to `git log`, invisible to CI,
// and silently absent on any other deployment of the image. Doing it at build time means the
// bytes ship inside the container and `server/src/server.js`'s staticCompressed middleware
// only has to pick the right file.
//
// Brotli at quality 11 is the maximum, which would be absurd per-request but is free here —
// it runs once per build, on assets that are then served thousands of times. gzip is emitted
// beside it for the rare client that negotiates no `br`.
//
// Measured on the 2026-08-03 bundle: 282,615 B of JS → ~72 KB, 93,532 B of CSS → ~13 KB.
